# Gender Classification using Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)

## Project Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning to predict gender based on smartphone usage patterns, HEXACO personality traits, and socioeconomic factors. Using three classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes), we explore the relationship between digital behavior, personality psychology, and gender with implications for targeted marketing and product strategy.

## Tools & Technologies
- R (tidyverse, caret, randomForest, e1071)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection and transformation
4. Model building:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Naive Bayes
5. Model comparison using accuracy and performance metrics
6. Business interpretation of results

## Key Outcomes
- Built multiple classification models to predict gender
- Compared model performance and accuracy
- Demonstrated practical application of machine learning for decision-making

## Files Included
- Full R code (R Markdown)
- Final analysis report (HTML)
- Dataset
